<Note>

- In this workshop I'll be going though the different aspects of the
  individual technologies used.
- Then ramping up as I go along.
- Shout out to Jason Lengstorf for introducing me to this concept.
- Let's take a look at the agenda.

# What is Markdown?

# ü§î

<Note>

- If you're not familiar with Markdown it's a way to enable simple
  editing in plain text files that can be converted to HTML.
- fun fact, this presentation is written in Markdown with JSX, more on
  that later though

# Markdown Showdown

Interactive guide: [ss10.dev/mdsd]

[ss10.dev/mdsd]: https://ss10.dev/mdsd

<Note>

- I did a talk on Markdown you can check it out at ss10.dev/mdsd
- Quick example of using Markdown would be

</Note>

---

<CodeHighlight>

```md
# Hello world

This is a paragraph
```

<Note>

- This would be in your text editor
- Then that would render to

</Note>

</CodeHighlight>

---

# Hello world

This is a paragraph

<Note>

- This
- As I mentioned earlier this presentation is written in Markdown
- Ok, next up MDX

</Note>

---

# What is MDX?

# ü§î

<Note>

- MDX is the next step with Markdown
- MDX is Markdown and JSX
- It allows you to add interactive components to your documentation

# Why Gatsby

<Note>

- Gatsby _is_ a static site generator, so there's no dynamic
  generation of pages when the pages are requested. The built output
  for a Gatsby site can be hosted on a CDN making it globally
  available and super scalable.
- Gatsby can use Markdown files to create pages in a site project.
  Gatsby will read the Markdown files into the Gatsby filesystem and
  transform the Markdown to HTML and then when building the site
  create static pages.
- The end result is a super fast site with little latency when
  requesting the pages.

</Note>

# Build

<Note>

- I'm going to build a Gatsby blog now

</Note>

# GraphCMS with MDX

# Let's talk about MDX

<Note>

- Just a little more time to talk about MDX
- and how awesome it is
- This presentation is made with MDX
- I recall the first time I discovered MDX for a presentation
  - Sara Viera at Vue Conf London 2018
- Being a blogger/digital gardener/thought pamphlet author this really
  useful
- This presentation is super bare bones, I didn't have time to make it
  pretty
- Why is it useful?
- MDX allows for the addition of JSX to Markdown, so React components
  in your documentation.
- MDX is a great tool for making interactive documentation no doubt
  you have seen sites like Josh Comeau's site which is jam packed with
  whimsy features powered by MDX

<Note>

- This was one of the first real world implementations of MDX in a
  site I found
- this blew my mind!
- Lets check it out quickly

</Note>

# ü§Ø

<Note>

- This led me down the path of wanting to incorporate MDX into my site
- And everthing else, see the slides title

<Note>

- I'm on the MDX Embed core team
- MDX Embed is pretty neat, it soon came to light that I wanted this
  for all the Tweets and YouTube videos I wanted to embed in my site
- MDX Embed means embedding things like

- Tweets

- CodePen's

## MDX Gatsby Plugin

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

<Note>

- Ok let's look at what we need to do to get set up with MDX in a
  Gatsby project

</Note>

---

## MDX Embed Gatsby Plugin

```bash
npm install mdx-embed gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed
```

<Note>

- FYI you can also add in MDX Embed at this point too

</Note>

---

<CodeHighlight>

```js {2}
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata,
  plugins: [
    // all other gatsby plugins
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
      options: {
        extensions: [`.mdx`, `.md`],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

<Note>

- Fun fact you don't explicitly have to define the file types, I
  discodered this on a live stream with James Q Quick
- The extension was wrong but still imported the files

</Note>

</CodeHighlight>

---

<CodeHighlight>

```js {7}
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  options: {
    extensions: [`.mdx`, `.md`],
    gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
      `gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files`,
      `gatsby-remark-assets`,
    ],
  },
},
```

<Note>

- You can also add in any Remark Plugins you might want as well

</Note>

</CodeHighlight>

---

<CodeHighlight>

```js {4}
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    path: `${__dirname}/content/`,
    name: `content`,
  },
},
```

<Note>

- I won't pretend to know how any of it works I'm ok with abstractions

</Note>

</CodeHighlight>

---

<CodeHighlight>

```jsx {3}
export const wrapPageElement = ({ element }) => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>
    <Layout>{element}</Layout>
  </MDXProvider>
)
```

<Note>

- High up in the component tree you need to wrap your MDX components
  in the MDXProvider
- This can be added to the gatsby-prowser and gatsby-ssr files

</Note>

</CodeHighlight>

---

<CodeHighlight>

```js
import { wrapPageElement as wrap } from './src/root-wrapper'

export const wrapPageElement = wrap
```

<Note>

- Or you can create on file and import that into the two files, both
  work but you're only maintaining one file the other way

</Note>

</CodeHighlight>

# Fin

<Note>

- This was the section where I was meant to talk about integrating MDX
  into NextJS
- Unfortunately I have run out of time on the slides for this, so I
  apologise for that
